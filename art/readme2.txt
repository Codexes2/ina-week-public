hi, codexes here.

to streamers and content creators:
weeks 1, 2, and 3's songs have not been changed. instead, the notable changes are the stages. if you only care for ina week, just play week 4, which is ina week.

there are also special notes in the game that you can change through the options menu. if you find the notes hard to see on certain stages, please go into Options > Appearance > Sanity Notes to change their appearance.

thanks, and have fun.
