if you're reading this, you're probably checking through the source files, along with other stuff you want to go through. kinda makes me happy in a way -- this was a 2-3 month development cycle, basically a summer passion project for me and the other devs. if there's any code you want to use for your own stuff, go for it. i ask that you simply give credit where credit is due.

from the bottom of my heart, thank you, and know that you're always loved and appreciated. 
stay safe and god bless.
